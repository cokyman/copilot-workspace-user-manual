# Getting Started with Copilot Workspace

Welcome to the technical preview for Copilot Workspace (CW)! ðŸ‘‹ CW is a "task-centric" dev environment, which allows you to define a task for a repo (using natural language), and then work on it with AI. And to get started, you can define or begin a task using one of the following entrypoints:

<table>
   <tr>
      <th width="300px">Entrypoint</th>
      <th width="600px">Screenshot</th>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <ins>GitHub Issue</ins><br /><br />If you've already got a GitHub issue which describes a task you'd like to perform, then you can simply open the issue and click the "Open in Workspace" button on the right side panel (underneath the "Development" section).<br /><br />This will open the issue within Copilot Workspace, and begin analyzing how to solve it.

      </td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <ins>Ad-hoc task (CW dashboard)</ins><br /><br />If you open the <a href="https://copilot-workspace.githubnext.com">Copilot Workspace dashboard</a>, you can click the "Choose a repository" option underneath the "Start a new session" section. This will let you search for the repository you want to work on, and after selecting it, will allow you to define a new task from scratch (kind of like a draft issue).<br /><br />And after you've performed a task against a repository, it will appear in the session list under the "Start a new session" section on the dashboard. That way, you can easily start new tasks against projects you're actively working on.

   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>
         <ins>Ad-hoc task (repo page)</ins><br /><br />As an alternative to the previous entrypoint, you can also navigate to the repository page for the project you'd like to work on, click the green "Code" button, and enter in a new task from the "Copilot" tab. Once you submit the task, it will take you into Copilot Workspace and begin analyzing how to solve it.
